This readme is yet to be written. Let's develop the game first, eh?

TODO:

 - Optimise rendering
   - Only switch textures/shaders if they're not already in use
   - Only generate/pass model matrix when necessary
 - Create GameObject class and move Transforms into it
 - Create cameras
 - Create a way to switch between 2D and 3D
 - Game states
 - Input handling
